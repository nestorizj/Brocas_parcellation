# Brocas_parcellation
 
This project is the main project from my doctorate work. 

- The initial objective wa to use two different kinds of MRI data (diffusion data and fMRI) to map brocas area creating thus a two different ways to parcellate Broca's area employing (1) information about the white matter connectivity and (2) time course information from the fMRI fluctuation. 

- The second objective was to find the correspondence between diffusion based parcellation and fMRI based parcellation of Broca's area. By comparing parcellation against each other. Employing topographic information like its placement and the placement of the different boundaries. 
- This was proven to to be more challenging that initially thought given the differences between data set and the information provided.
