# Brocas_parcellation
 
This project is the main project from my doctorate work. 

- The initial objective was to use two different kinds of MRI data (diffusion data:information about the white matter connectivity and structure and fMRI:time-series correlation between voxels in Broca's area and the rest of the brain) to map Brocas area, creating thus two different ways to map this important language region. 

- With the information from each parcellation, the second main objective was to find the correspondence between the two types of parcellation methods. I compared parcellation against each other trying to find out whether the structural connectivity drives and correspond with the functional activity and/or viceversa. I employed topographic information like: placement of the different boundaries between subdivions. 
. 
- This was proven to to be more challenging that initially thought given the differences between data set and the information provided by both methods. Thus far it is inconclusive if structure drives function. Though certainly structure is the vessel from wich information is conduncted to multiple organizational hubs. However, the area definition and changes in connectivity pattern can be seen in both methods where the center of mass of the borders between regions overlaps.
